Milky Way Galaxy Homework - Written Answers
===========================================

- How would you find these parameters if only 4D coordinates were given: ra, dec, D, v_los?

Because the Sun's velocity in the galactocentric frame contains components in the x, y,
and z directions, measurements of the radial velocity v_los provide sufficient information
to obtain 6D phase space coordinates. However, the solar motion becomes increasingly negligible
at larger galactocentric radii, meaning that this method becomes increasingly inaccurate.

- Now use the file data_err.txt, which includes errors of 0.5 mas/yr in the proper motion
  coordinates. How would you find the velocity anisotropy and net rotation in this case?

The effect of errors in the proper motions will be to introduce additional Gaussian terms in the
reconstructed velocity distribution function (assuming random errors). Transforming to galacto-
centric coordinates will result in these terms being spread over all three velocity components.
Therefore, a fit of the distribution function would need to be performed including the error terms
to determine the underlying velocity dispersions.

- What does the net rotation and velocity anisotropy of halo stars tell us about the formation
  of the Milky Way halo?

These parameters may be used as a probe of the formation history of the Milky Way. For example,
a velocity anistropy close to 0 would suggest a relatively large number of mergers, whereas a
significant anistropy and/or net rotation would suggest the merger history is dominated by a
single larger merger. This merger is also likely to have occured relatively recently, since over
sufficiently long timescales perturbations to stars' motions will decrease the degree of isotropy.
