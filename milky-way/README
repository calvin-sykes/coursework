Milky Way Galaxy Homework
=========================

Included in this zip file are:

data.txt - for convenience, the provided input data.
stars.py - a Python program implementing the first two assignments.
           To run it you need python3, matplotlib, numpy and astropy.
	   The data file must be specified via command line argument:

           ./stars.py --filename data.txt

           The program will write the 6D coordinates to  the file '6d.txt'
	   and print the calculated velocity dispersions, v_rot and beta.
	   The optional argument --plots can be supplied to also produce
	   some histograms of the positions and velocities of the stars.
  6d.txt - the output data produced by the program.
written-answers.txt - a text file containing answers to the written assignments.
